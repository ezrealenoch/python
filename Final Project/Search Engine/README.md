INSTRUCTIONS:

	1) Make sure index (database) "Indexed" directory is located within the same folder as python script
	
	2) Start server with command "python searchengine.py" which will open up a server on "http://localhost:8000/"
	This can be navigated by entering "http://localhost:8000/" in a web browser.
	
	3) Enter Keywords or Titles of searches in Search Bar and submit
	
	4) Number of Results, Search Time, and Results are displayed  
	
	
	Bonus: Not sure this counts for credit but I used a google search API that I manually run as a service with 
	my google account. This can be executed by running the command "python trywebserver.py" in the same directory
	and loading up the search engine on "http://localhost:8000/"
